Force browsers to load the most recent file if modified.

== Description ==

Saves you from asking "have you emptied your cache?".

**Features**

* Safe to leave running on live sites.
* Only refreshes browser cache for a file if it has been modified.
* Resolves caching issues with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) as well. No need to purge your CDN cache.
* "Just works" â€” no configuration necessary.

**Requirements**

Requires scripts use any of the below functions to load. Almost all files meet these requirements. The only case it doesn't account for is when URLs are hard-coded. This shouldn't ever be done, since it can break sites for other reasons.

* [wp_enqueue_style](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style)
* [wp_enqueue_script](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script)
